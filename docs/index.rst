Welcome to XChainPy2's documentation!
=====================================

**XChainPy2** is a collection of Python libraries for interacting with various blockchains. It is a freestyle port of XChainJS library,
which was written in JavaScript. The goal of XChainPy2 is to provide a simple, consistent interface for interacting with different blockchains, making it easy to build cross-chain applications.
